For your second question about keeping this updated more easily, I recommend creating a PowerShell script that you can run quickly. Here's a script you can use:
Project Structure Update ScriptClick to open code
To use this:

Save the script as update-structure.ps1 in your project root

Run it with: .\update-structure.ps1

It will create/update project-structure.md with the latest structure
You can then share that file with me

The script:

Excludes node_modules and other build directories
Includes file sizes
Creates a hierarchical view
Updates automatically with timestamps
Is much faster than manual directory listing
